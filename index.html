						<h5>We introduced an FLL team "Metalloids" to the different aspects of FLL, like Core Values and Robot Design. In addition, we taught them the basics of programming and shared our experiences with them. At the end of the session, the team was able to program the EV3 Gyro sensor and had incorporated it in their robot runs.</h5>
						<h5>We also mentored a robotics team from Amity International School, who were new to the Arduino platform. We provided them with the necessary resources and technical expertise to help them make a robot capable of imitating human gestures for a competition called "Odyssey of the Mind," where they stood second.</h5>

						<h5>FTC provided us with the exciting opportunity to impart out knowledge of robotics to those who are not so fortunate to have acquired such knowledge. We went to an NGO and introduced the children to LEGO Mindstorms platform.</h5>
                        <h5>Over the course of the workshop, the children learnt about all the aspects involved in building a simple robot. They put their creativity to the test by designing simple, yet innovative, robots.</h5>

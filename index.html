We interacted with various young children, who were very inquisitive about robotics and excited to get their hands on the robots we had made. It was really inspiring to see that our work had been able to engender scientific interest in the community.</h5>

						<h5>We introduced an FLL team "Metalloids" to the different aspects of FLL, like Core Values and Robot Design. In addition, we taught them the basics of programming and shared our experiences with them. At the end of the session, the team was able to program the EV3 Gyro sensor and had incorporated it in their robot runs.</h5>
						<h5>We also mentored a robotics team from Amity International School, who were new to the Arduino platform. We provided them with the necessary resources and technical expertise to help them make a robot capable of imitating human gestures for a competition called "Odyssey of the Mind," where they stood second.</h5>
